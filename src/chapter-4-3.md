Seeking feedback is another effective strategy for developing a growth mindset and pursuing deliberate practice. Feedback allows us to identify areas for improvement and adjust our approach accordingly. Seek feedback from teachers, mentors, or peers regularly to ensure you are on the right track towards achieving your learning goals.

Reflecting on Progress

Reflecting on progress is also an essential component of developing a growth mindset and pursuing deliberate practice. Regularly reflect on your learning journey, including your successes and setbacks, to identify areas for improvement and celebrate your progress.
